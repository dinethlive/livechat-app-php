<h3>Summary</h3>
I built this chat app for my daily use. I know this one is really simple. But I
needed light weight chat app without using ANY database. So I did it. I used php
script who written like this. Then I added some functions for my purpose.
<hr />

<h3>How Live Chat App Works ?</h3>
<p>I mention main files with their functions down below</p>
<h4><b>index.php</b></h4>
<p>This is main file. You can see main template available on this file</p>
<h4><b>log.html</b></h4>
<p>Every messages save on this file</p>
<h4><b>post.php</b></h4>
<p>This file post user messages on log.html file. (including time)</p>
<h4><b>clear.php</b></h4>
<p>
  This one works like DELETE ALL message function. If user hit clear button ,
  log.html file will be cleared
</p>

<h3>How to run LiveChat APP on localhost</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>First</b> you have to install any php server. (I used XAMP)</li>
  <li><b>Second</b> open web browser and type localhost in the address bar</li>
  <li><b>Third</b> You can see Login interface</li>
  <li><b>Do your changes !!!</b></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Why I did this ?</h3>
<p>
  I love to work with php most of time. But I never use anymore php for future
  projects.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
  I hope to add more functions in future. And enhance security of Chat-App.
  Don't care about styles :)
